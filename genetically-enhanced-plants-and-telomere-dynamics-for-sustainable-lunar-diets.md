**Lunar AgriGen Mission:** Enhancing Astronaut Health with Radiation-Resistant Plants

**Project Overview:** This project aims to tackle the significant challenge of ensuring sustainable food production for lunar missions. It focuses on the development of genetically modified plants to improve astronauts' diets and investigates the effects of lunar conditions on telomere dynamics. By merging disciplines such as molecular biology, plant genetics, space biology, and nutritional science, this project aims to make a pivotal contribution to the future success of lunar colonization efforts.

**Objective**: The Lunary AgriGen mission is dedicated to advancing astronaut health during long-term lunar expeditions. By leveraging genetically engineered plants, we aim to introduce a sustainable nutritional source that thrives in lunar conditions while mitigating the harmful impacts of cosmic radiation.

**Strategy**: Our approach involves the development of crops that are genetically modified to express higher levels of antioxidants and proteins, inspired by the radiation resilience found in tardigrades. These enhancements are intended to reduce oxidative stress caused by radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), essential for protecting astronauts from radiation's adverse health effects.&#x20;



## Lunar Agriculture Project Objectives

### 1. **Engineering Lunar-Adapted Plants**

Our primary goal is to develop plant species engineered to thrive in the harsh conditions of the lunar surface. These transgenic plants will be tailored to adapt to lunar regolith's unique qualities and withstand the increased levels of radiation, all while producing nutrient-rich, edible components to support human missions.

### 2. **Studying Telomere Dynamics Under Lunar Conditions**

A key area of our research will focus on understanding how the lunar environment, characterized by its cosmic radiation and microgravity, affects telomere dynamics in these genetically modified organisms. Insights into telomere length management and its link to genome stability are vital for the success of lunar agriculture.

### 3. **Nutritional Evaluation and Diet Planning**

The project will conduct extensive analyses of the produced plants to assess their nutritional value, aiming to integrate them into dietary plans tailored for astronauts. These plans will consider the specific nutritional needs and the unique conditions of living on the lunar surface to ensure astronauts' long-term health and well
