# AI Action plan

**To coordinate a group of researchers in formulating a research paper using the NASA GeneLab data repository to examine data about mineral nutrition and changes to ion transport caused by microgravity and spaceflight, follow this plan:**

* **Assemble a team: Gather researchers with expertise in areas such as space biology, ion transport, mineral nutrition, and data analysis.**
* **Define the research question: Clearly outline the specific research question(s) to be addressed, focusing on the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on mineral nutrition and ion transport.**
* **Familiarize with the GeneLab data repository: Ensure all team members understand how to access and navigate the NASA GeneLab data repository, which contains valuable datasets related to space biology.**
* **Identify relevant datasets: Search the GeneLab repository for datasets that contain information on mineral nutrition and ion transport in microgravity and spaceflight conditions.**
* **Data analysis: Assign team members to analyze the selected datasets, focusing on identifying patterns, trends, and significant findings related to the research question(s).**
* **Literature review: Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on the topic to provide context and support for the research findings.** [**https://elicit.org/**](https://elicit.org/) **-> AI assisted literature review**
* **Interpretation and discussion: Collaborate as a team to interpret the results and discuss their implications in the context of existing knowledge and potential applications.**
* **Draft the research paper: Divide the paper into sections (e.g., introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion) and assign team members to write each section based on their expertise.**
* **Peer review and editing: Have team members review and edit each other's sections to ensure clarity, accuracy, and coherence.**
* **Finalize the paper: Incorporate feedback from the peer review process and finalize the research paper, ensuring proper formatting and citation of sources.**
* **Submit the paper: Identify a suitable journal or conference for submission and follow their guidelines to submit the research paper for review and potential publication.**
