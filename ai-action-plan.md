# AI Action plan

**Please contact Richard Barker to learn more about the use of AI to draft research paper outlines.**

To coordinate a group of researchers in formulating a research paper using the NASA GeneLab data repository to examine data about mineral nutrition and changes to ion transport caused by microgravity and spaceflight, follow this plan:

* **Assemble a team:** Gather researchers with expertise in areas such as space biology, ion transport, mineral nutrition, and data analysis.
* **Define the research question:** Clearly outline the specific research question(s) to be addressed, focusing on the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on mineral nutrition and ion transport.
* **Familiarize with the GeneLab data repository:** Ensure all team members understand how to access and navigate the NASA GeneLab data repository, which contains valuable datasets related to space biology.
* **Identify relevant datasets:** Search the GeneLab repository for datasets that contain information on mineral nutrition and ion transport in microgravity and spaceflight conditions.
* **Data analysis:** Assign team members to analyze the selected datasets, focusing on identifying patterns, trends, and significant findings related to the research question(s).
* **Literature review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on the topic to provide context and support for the research findings. eg. [https://elicit.org/](https://elicit.org/) -> AI assisted literature review
* **Interpretation and discussion:** Collaborate as a team to interpret the results and discuss their implications in the context of existing knowledge and potential applications.
* **Select Target Journal(s):** There are many different journals, finding one that is suitable for your research findings and writing style is important as it defines the paramaters for the final report/paper.&#x20;
* **Draft the research paper:** Divide the paper into sections (e.g., introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion) and assign team members to write each section based on their expertise.
* **Peer review and editing:** Have team members review and edit each other's sections to ensure clarity, accuracy, and coherence.
* **Finalize the paper(s):** Incorporate feedback from the peer review process and finalize the research paper, ensuring proper formatting and citation of sources.
* **Submit the paper: I**dentify a suitable journal or conference for submission and follow their guidelines to submit the research paper for review and potential publication.
